# Generate music with Markov Chains

Use the supplied midi music or supply your own and generate new music using markov chains.
You can run the program yourself or check it out running on my website, [oarfish.dev](http://oarfish.dev)

## Available Scripts

You will need nodejs and npm to run the project.
Node js can be downloaded at [nodejs.dev](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once installed you will need a command line to run `npm`.
Powershell if windows, terminal if linux or Mac.

Navigate to the project directory from the command line. From here you can run:

### `npm install`

Run this first to install all the packages.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
Use this command as `npm run build` will need a server set up to view it.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
